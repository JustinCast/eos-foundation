#### Hello, and welcome to the beginning of something important. We view EOS Foundation as a container for facilitating code, capital, and connections in ways which haven't been available so far for EOS Mainnet community.

Our first step is to get key participants in this group of Advisor and Genesis Steward Candidates who can help steer this project forward to a fully-launched DAO. The first action item is to get feedback and review of initial draft documents as part of our roadmap to launch.

#### First documents for review and participation:
